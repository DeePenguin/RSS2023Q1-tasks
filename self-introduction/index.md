My name is Kristina and you may know me as deepenguin.

So, what to tell about myself? I used to live in St. Petersburg, but due to some events I had to move to Tbilisi, and I've been living here for a year now.
I have some passions in my life: house plants, dogs and various kinds of art.
Currently, I'm enrolled in a front end development course at Rolling Scopes school. That's why i must to introduce myself even if I don't want to. The course is proving to be both fascinating and extremely challenging. I must admit, this is not my first attempt at finishing this program, but I am determined to see it through to the end this time. I really hope so. I guess,  it's my fourth attempt, with significant breaks in between.

My previous attempts ended somewhere in the middle of the course as each time I received a promotion and had to deal with new tasks and  responsibilities, making it challenging to find time for studying.

I chose web development since I am passionate about creating something  beautiful from nothing. The visual part of the result  is of great importance to me.

About job. Despite my lack of technical education or background in IT, I spent four years working in big IT corporation in moderation team. I started off as a simple moderator and worked my way up the ranks to become a senior specialist, then a team leader, and eventually, I ended something in-between automation and data analytics. Honestly I still dont know how to name it.

Having quit my job a year ago, I am here to broaden my horizons, train for meaningful employment opportunities, and transform my passion into a career.
